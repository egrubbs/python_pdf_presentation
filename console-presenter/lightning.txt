What Happens When A Python Hacker Gets P☃☎★♅d Off With GUI Presentation Tools
◦
Michael Hudson-Doyle

(based on a true story)

I wanted to give a talk in the "one short sentence per slide" style.

Tried Open Office.

Aaarrgh!
(well, you know)

Tried a little to install Bruce.

Aaarrgh!
(not packaged)

(or released, even, at the time)

Tried mgp.

Aaarrgh!
(random X errors)

Meanwhile had written the sentences I wanted to say in a text file.

So wrote a simple script that dug the sentences of the file and printed them one at a time.

{{{
for slide in slides:
    os.system('clear')
    print '\n'*10
    print slide
    raw_input()
}}}

Problem: couldn't go backwards.

Solution: terminal hacking!

(Obviously)

Stole scary code from my old pyrepl project.

For example:

{{{
self.__svtermstate = \
    tcgetattr(self.input_fd)
raw = self.__svtermstate.copy()
raw.lflag &=~ \
 (termios.ICANON|termios.ECHO|
  termios.IEXTEN|termios.ISIG)
raw.oflag &=~ (termios.OPOST)
raw.cflag |=  (termios.CS8)
...
tcsetattr(self.input_fd,
 termios.TCSADRAIN, raw)
}}}

Then

{{{
i = 0
while i < len(slides):
    show_slide(i)
    e = get_event()
    if e.name == 'left':
       i -= 1
    else:
       i += 1
}}}

From there, just a short step to dissolve transitions, *bold* support etc.
